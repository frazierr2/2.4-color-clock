# 2.4 Color Clock

This project continues is the first of the Javascript for the cohort. We were tasked with creating a clock that counts down and the color changes every second with what the hexidecimal number equals.



### Tech Used

During the development of this project I used the following technology:


* [HTML5] - latest version of Hypertext Markup Language, the code that describes web pages
* [CSS3] - latest evolution of the Cascading Style Sheets language
* [Twitter Bootstrap] - great UI boilerplate for modern web apps
* [jQuery] - fast and concise Javascript Library
